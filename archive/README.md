# Archive Directory

This directory contains old research, documentation, and experimental code that was used during the development phase.

## Contents

### old_research/
Old documentation and research files:
- Initial research on SPY/SPX arbitrage
- Account signup guides
- Data access investigations
- Various strategy analyses
- Temporal architecture notes (not used in final system)

### old_code/
Old code and backtests:
- Backtest scripts with simulated data
- Early strategy implementations
- Test files for various brokers (Alpaca, E*TRADE)
- CSV export files from backtests

## Why Archived?

These files were useful during research and development but are not needed for running the production system. The final system is documented in:

- `../STRATEGY_AND_SYSTEM.md` - Complete documentation
- `../README.md` - Quick start guide
- `../main.py` - Production system

## Note

You can safely delete this entire `archive/` directory if you want a cleaner project. All important information has been consolidated into the main documentation.
